# CRAN Task View Analysis

This repository contains the code for the analysis of the [CRAN Task View for epidemiology](https://github.com/cran-task-views/Epidemiology).

## ðŸŽ¯ Aims

CRAN Task Views are a collection of R packages related to a specific topic.
But are these packages reliable, updated, and in line with current community best practices?

We perform a reproducible, and reusable, analysis of the Epidemiology CRAN Task View, aiming to:

  - Evaluate the ecosystem health and resilience
  - Identify training and support needs

## ðŸ“¦ Re-usability

This analysis is designed with re-usability in mind. It can be run on any other software ecosystem represented by a CRAN Task View.

To do so, edit the name of the Task View to analyze in `settings.yml`

Alternatively, you can also provide a custom list of packages, without needing to rely on a Task View, in the `packages` field of `settings.yml`.
